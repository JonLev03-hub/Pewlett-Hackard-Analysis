## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The purpose of this study was to sort through the employee lists provided to create a list of all employees that are eligable for retirement, and eligable for a mentor program. To do this I will be using an SQL database. 

## Results
Starting with a bit over 300,000 past and present employees, I have organized the data so that you can easily tell what employees are eligable for either retirement or the mentorship program. 

###### Requirements for Retirement
1) Currently Employed
2) A Birth Date Between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955

###### Requirements for Mentorship
1) Currently Employed
2) Birth Date Between 1/1/1965 and 12/31/1965

To easily show the management what positions will need filled most after the employees retire one table shows how many people are ready for retirement by position. For a full list you can refrence the CSV's provided in the analysis. 

As far as the mentor program goes they only asked for a full list of people eligable and no summarized list since the dataset is much smaller; only consisting of approximately 1500 names.  

## Summary 

To summarize the number of people that are ready for retirement per position i have linked the table below. This shows how many people there are that meet the requirements per title.

When it comes to the mentor program there are just over 1500 people that are eligable listed in the Mentorship_eligability.csv file.
